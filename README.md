# Sucker-Rod-Pump-Dynacard-Classification
This project aims to classify sucker rod pump dynacards into various operational statuses using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and provide actionable recommendations to address potential issues. The application is deployed via Streamlit, allowing users to upload dynacard images or document files (PDF, PowerPoint, Word) for classification and troubleshooting.
# Key Features

* Classification: Identifies the operational status of the sucker rod pump, such as "Ideal Card," "Gas Interference," "Fluid Pound," etc.

* Recommendations: Provides solutions for non-ideal classifications to optimize pump performance.

* Flexible Input: Accepts images (JPG, PNG) or document files (PDF, PowerPoint, Word) and extracts relevant dynacard images for analysis.

* Streamlit Deployment: User-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
